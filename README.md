## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a global e-commerce sales dataset.

The objective is to analyze revenue patterns, marketing channel performance, customer trends, and operational efficiency to generate actionable business insights.

Using Python-based data analytics tools, raw transactional data was transformed into meaningful visualizations and strategic recommendations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data.  
However, without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:

- Identify top revenue-generating markets  
- Measure marketing channel effectiveness  
- Compare platform performance (Website vs Mobile App)  
- Evaluate shipping efficiency  
- Understand product-level contribution to revenue  

This project solves these challenges through structured data analysis and visualization.

## 🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

- User ID  
- Order ID  
- Purchase Timestamp  
- Shipping Timestamp  
- Product Name & Product ID  
- Product Price (USD)  
- Purchase Platform  
- Marketing Channel  
- Account Creation Method  
- Country Code

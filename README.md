# 📊 Global E-Commerce Sales & Marketing Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a global e-commerce sales dataset.  
The objective is to analyze revenue patterns, marketing channel performance, customer trends, and operational efficiency to generate actionable business insights.

Using Python-based data analytics tools, raw transactional data was transformed into meaningful visualizations and strategic recommendations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data.  
However, without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:

- Identify top revenue-generating markets
- Measure marketing channel effectiveness
- Compare platform performance (Website vs Mobile App)
- Evaluate shipping efficiency
- Understand product-level contribution to revenue

This project aims to solve these challenges through structured data analysis and visualization.

The dataset includes:

- User ID
- Order ID
- Purchase Timestamp
- Shipping Timestamp
- Product Name & Product ID
- Product Price (USD)
- Purchase Platform
- Marketing Channel
- Account Creation Method
- Country Code
